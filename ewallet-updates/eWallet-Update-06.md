# eWallet Update 06



The last two weeks of [eWallet](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/) development were focused on finishing up bug testing on 1.0.pre0, bootstrapping the new POS \(Point of Sale\) mobile applications we’re building as well as designing the eWallet blockchain integration.

EDIT - consolidating a few points that came up in comments:

* POS -&gt; Point of Sale
* The Point of Sale merchant and client apps are sample user-facing apps built with the SDK, to demonstrate how a merchant could implement the SDK for a real world use case.
* We expect a working version of the Android merchant and iOS client apps to be ready by the end of this week. We will continue to make further improvements from there, and once we are satisfied that these two are complete we will build Android client and iOS merchant apps.
* These apps are "demos" in that they will not be made available on any app store, but a merchant will be able to use them as is to create their own eWallet. The functionality is a simple POS system, similar to the Starbucks loyalty card system.
