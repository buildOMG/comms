We did our best to take a little time off for the holidays[,](https://imgur.com/gallery/lOuTa2H) but we still made a big step forward at the tail end of December with the release of version [1.1.0-pre.0](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/releases/tag/v1.1.0-pre.0). This is a pre-release, meaning a candidate for release which will undergo thorough testing and some final tweaks before going on to become the version 1.1 stable release.

### Coming up:

We’ll be working on the remaining improvements and additions as well as lots of testing in order to take v1.1 from release candidate to production. And since we never stop looking ahead, we’ll be meeting in the coming weeks to nail down our approach to the next version once v1.1 is out.

As always, you can also follow our progress on the eWallet[ Waffle board](https://waffle.io/omisego/ewallet) and in our GitHub [Milestones](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/milestone/2) page.
