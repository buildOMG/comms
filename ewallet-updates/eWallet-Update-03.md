Hello! We’re back for another quick update on this week’s eWallet progress.

What has been done on the [eWallet](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/)?

* Once again, we’ve spent time testing, writing tests and fixing the bugs that came out \([\#351](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/pull/351), [\#352](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/pull/352), [\#353](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/pull/353), [\#354](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/pull/354), [\#355](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/pull/355), [\#356](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/pull/356), [\#331](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/pull/331), [\#336](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/pull/336), [\#337](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/pull/337)\)

The next steps:

* Improve websocket support for the Android SDK
* Draft OIP for private contracts \([OIP-5](https://github.com/omisego/OIP/issues/5)\)
* Draft OIP for key management \([OIP-6](https://github.com/omisego/OIP/issues/6)\)
* Draft OIP for blockchain adapter \([OIP-7](https://github.com/omisego/OIP/issues/7)\)
* Start working on a new sample mobile application to illustrate merchant/user interactions allowed by the eWallet

We have also started migrating tasks from our private issue tracker to a [public issue tracker](https://waffle.io/omisego/ewallet) which uses [GitHub issues and PRs](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/issues). This will allow everyone to more easily track eWallet development progress as well as encourage open discussion and contributions from the community \(that’s you!\) regarding feature implementation.
